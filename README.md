# entity_recognition
The Jupyter Notebook helps identify entities within a specific set of words, and helps classify those using the spacy API.
I created a set of data to test on, as there was already trained data that the classifier was trained on through the spacy API.
Additionally, I placed a few annotations and ran it through my entire model.
